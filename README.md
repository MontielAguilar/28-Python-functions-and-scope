## Implemented Functions

### 1. Function to print a string

The `function(word)` function takes a string as an argument and prints it.

### 2. Function to filter numbers divisible by 5 in a list

The `list(lst)` function filters the elements of a list and prints those that are divisible by 5.

### 3. Function to filter numbers divisible by 5 and return a new list

The `list(lst)` function filters the elements of a list and returns a new list with those that are divisible by 5.

### 4. Function to concatenate arguments

The `multiplesparametros(*numeritosypalabritas)` function converts a series of numbers and words into a string, separating each element by an underscore.

### 5. Function to perform mathematical operations with optional arguments.

The `realizar_operacion(x, y, op="add", ret_type="int")` function performs mathematical operations between two numbers according to the value of "op" and returns the result with the specified type. It allows specifying the operation to be performed ("add", "sub", "mul", "div") and the return type ("int", "float", "str").

### 6. Function to apply an operation to a list of numbers

The `apply_op(op, *args)` function receives an operation and a list of numbers, and applies the operation to the numbers in the list, returning the result.

### 7. Function to process a list of strings and generate a new element

The `procesar_lista(input_lista)` function receives a list of strings and generates a new string with the beginning of each one. Then, it adds this new element to the end of the list without modifying variables outside of its scope.

### 8. Function to add exclamation marks to a list of strings

The `apply_op(op, *args)` function receives a list of strings and generates a new list with an exclamation mark added to the end of each string.

## Function Documentation

Detailed documentation has been provided for each function, including description, parameters, return value, and usage examples.

## Usage

You can use these functions in your Python projects to perform mathematical operations, manipulate lists and strings, among other useful operations.
